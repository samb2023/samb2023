# 👋 Hi, I'm Samruddhi

I design and automate **cloud-native systems** that are secure, scalable, and built for reliability.  
My experience spans **AWS**, **GCP**, **Kubernetes**, and **Terraform**, with a deep focus on **CI/CD automation**, **infrastructure-as-code**, and **cloud security compliance**.
 
I enjoy simplifying complex systems, automating everything from deployment to monitoring, and building solutions that balance performance, security, and compliance.

🧩 **Core Expertise:**  
Cloud Infrastructure • CI/CD Pipelines • Terraform • Kubernetes • Jenkins • Docker • Python • Vault • Monitoring • Linux • Compliance Automation
